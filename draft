Good to turn-in, with a few caveats:
1. Sometimes the "died" message prints a time before the other messages
	- Easy fix: instead of printing when the philo died, print current time
	- If it doesn't matter for defense, who cares
2. I'm not protecting pthread create, etc...
	- Shouldn't be too hard to add the logic but I CBA
	- Again if it doesn't matter for defense, who cares - funcs are never gonna fail
3. Philos increment that one value
	- Should be ok, but maybe defense says something somewhere about this
	- Easy fix but annoying because the way I do it now should be fine
4. Bonuses
	- Semaphores. Can have some fun with it and learn something new.
	- Depends how pressed for time I am, but I'd rather do it.

Rest should be good. Program works well, behaves well, code is extra-clean.

Roadmap:
- Work on turning in FdF and getting 6 points
- If during those 6 points I get a philosopher evaluation, great
- If not, I can ask people I know
- Or I can just go for it and say fuck it, at worst it's one wasted point, it's fine
- Depending on the results, either recode some stuff, or do the bonuses
- Then move on to minishell
