## Theory

Philosophers take turn
eating
sleeping
thinking

Each philosopher is its own thread

To eat, a philosopher needs to lock his left fork and right fork, which are shared with other threads
To lock forks, use mutexes so a thread has to wait for another to access a value in memory

There are as many forks as philosophers (1 philosopher will die, it only has 1 fork)

Program params are the amount of philosophers, and various time settings like how long they can survive without eating
Too strict params mean the philosophers necessarily have to die

Good params should allow philosophers to stay alive

The program will print what philosophers are doing (e.g "Philosopher 1 is eating"), along with maybe a timestamp

Philosophers spend a certain amount of time eating

They spend a certain amount of time sleeping after eating (mandatory)

They then wake up and can either wait (thinking) or start eating again, if the forks are available

Philosophers shouldn't trade info with each other or know when others are about to die.
They should all just adopt a general strategy that will work optimally for everyone.
Logically, philosophers should at the very least know their number and be able to adapt their strategy based on it. (nothing seems to prevent it in the subject)

## Concrete

./philosophers [num_philosophers] [time_to_die] [time_to_eat] [time_to_sleep] [number_of_times_to_eat]

Time values are expressed in MILLISECONDS

The last argument is optional. Without it, the simulation runs forever or until a philosopher dies (Ctrl+C to stop it).
With it, once every philosopher has eaten AT LEAST the number of times to eat, the simulation stops (philosophers continue being simulated after reaching the target and can still die)

Philosophers have a number ranging from 1 to num_philo. They sit around a round table so 1 sits next to 2 and N

State changes need to be displayed as follows:

timestamp_in_ms X has taken a fork
				  is eating
					 sleeping
					 thinking
				  died

Messages of death must be displayed within 10ms of actual death (.. ?)

## Useful functions

printf - better than ft_printf (faster)

memset - better than ft_memset (faster)

pthread_create
pthread_detach
pthread_join
pthread_mutex_init
pthread_mutex_destroy
pthread_mutex_lock
pthread_mutex_unlock


## Bonus

Use semaphores... TBD
